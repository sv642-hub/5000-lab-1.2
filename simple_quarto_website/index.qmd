### Life formulas by Stoics
Marcus Aurelius held that $\text{Good} = \text{Virtue}$[^1] and that external things like wealth or fame are indifferent.

[^1]: Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, Book II — on virtue as the only good.

This is the formula Tranquility that Stoics like to use, this helps us concentrate on our actions adn that we are dependent on ourselves:
$$
\text{Tranquility} = \frac{\text{Things within our control}}{\text{Total things}}
$$
